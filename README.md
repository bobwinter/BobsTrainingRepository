# BobsTrainingRepository
Something I created for the 10-minute intro.
I don't see a Commit Changes button
Matt discovered ya gotta click Preview Changes to make that button appear
i also added a line, because changing the formatting didn't seem to qualify as a change.

Now I'm gonna try and create another branch directly off the Master, ignoring the changes I made in my earlier new branch.
