# BobsTrainingRepository
Something I created for the 10-minute intro.
I don't see a Commit Changes button
Matt discovered ya gotta click Preview Changes to make that button appear
i also added a line, because changing the formatting didn't seem to qualify as a change.

I've skipped a line, to see what effect that has.
I've also noticing that my attempt to chaneg from soft wrap to no wrap failed.  I'll try it again, though.
